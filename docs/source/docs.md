### [<i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hot Module Reloading (HMR)](docs/hmr.html)

Hot Module Reloading, or Replacement, is a feature where you inject update modules in a running
application. This opens up the possibility to time travel in the application without loosing context.
It also makes it easier to try out changes in the functionality while retaining the state of the 
application.
